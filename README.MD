## What is this?
ShadyAddons is the most popular QoL[^qol] mod for [Hypixel SkyBlock](https://hypixel.net/categories/skyblock.194/). Since its launch in July of 2021, it has amassed more than 20,000 users in 118 countries, with a peak of 921 users online at one time[^peak]. I am tremendously grateful to the community that has formed around my mod, and for the skills that working on it has taught me. It began as a way to learn Java and kill time during quarantine. Since, it has allowed me to practice a plethora of additional skills, everything from accepting web payments, to design, to server administration, and more.

Type `/sh` to open the settings.

## What's going on?
I am open sourcing ShadyAddons in the hope that the community can breathe new life into it. I haven't played SkyBlock in almost a year, so you can imagine that it's difficult to find motivation to work on Shady. I will continue to pay for and maintain the website and backend.

## What can I do?
If you're not a coder, don't worry! You can continue suggesting features in the Discord server. If you have a more fleshed out idea or a bug report, consider opening an issue and detailing it so someone else can build the feature.
